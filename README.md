# NewsMonkey
News Monkey is created in React JS class based components, as I was making it while learning it. The future scope of the project is to implement: country wise sorting of news categories and a search button implementation at the navbar to search the news title in the current page.

As the newsapi.org's developer plan does not allow me to host it on GitHub, it can only be displayed on the npm development server(local host).
